# ComplexityMeasures

-The "dataset" folder contains a few datasets with binary and multi-class problems. All the datasets are numerical and have no missing values.

-The complexity.py file has the code to run the complexity measures. At the end of the code the Complexity class is instantiated and an example is shown of how to
call all the public methods.
